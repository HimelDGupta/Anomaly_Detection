# Anomaly_Detection
This project focuses on developing an anomaly detection system tailored for surveillance video analysis, leveraging the UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset. Our goal is to identify unusual activities or events that deviate from the norm in public spaces, potentially indicating emergencies, security breaches, or safety hazards.
