Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an anomaly detection system tailored for surveillance video analysis, leveraging the UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset. Our goal is to identify unusual activities or events that deviate from the norm in public spaces, potentially indicating emergencies, security breaches, or safety hazards. The system employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to process and analyze video data, aiming to provide real-time alerts and insights.

Features
Real-time Anomaly Detection: Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect anomalies in surveillance footage as they occur.
Data Preprocessing: Implements preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of input data for better analysis results.
Model Training and Evaluation: Details the process of training machine learning models on the UCSD dataset, including parameter tuning and performance evaluation.
Visualization: Offers tools for visualizing anomalies within video footage, aiding in the interpretation of detection results.
Dataset
The UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset comprises videos recorded from surveillance cameras in the UCSD campus, annotated for anomalies. It includes diverse scenarios where anomalies, such as bikers, skaters, and vehicles, appear in pedestrian zones. This dataset is pivotal for training and evaluating our detection models.

Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for developing the anomaly detection system.
OpenCV: Employed for video processing and manipulation.
TensorFlow: Utilized for building and training deep learning models.
Numpy & Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
